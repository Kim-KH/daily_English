    "content": "South Korea President Lee's election law violation hearing postponed indefinitely, court says.\n\nSEOUL, June 9 (Reuters) - A Seoul court said on Monday it will indefinitely postpone a trial of President Lee Jae-myung on charges of violating election law in 2022.\nSouth Korea's Supreme Court ruled in May, before Lee was elected, that Lee had violated election law by publicly making \"false statements\" during his 2022 presidential bid, and sent the case back to an appeals court\n\nThe Seoul High Court, which had scheduled a hearing for the case on June 18, said on Monday that it will postpone the hearing \"to be decided later\" without a date, a court spokesperson confirmed.\n\nLee's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe court said its decision to postpone the hearing was due to \"Constitution Article 84\", without elaborating.\nSouth Korea's Constitution, Article 84, says a sitting president is \"not subject to criminal prosecution while in office\" for most crimes.\nHowever, legal experts are divided on whether that applies to ongoing trials that were already prosecuted before a president was elected.\nThe National Court Administration under the Supreme Court gave as its opinion that judges of each court where Lee's trials are being held will have to decide whether to stop or proceed, according to its statement to a lawmaker in May.\n\n\"The court in charge of hearing the case will determine whether Article 84 of the Constitution should be applied to a criminal defendant who was elected in the presidential election,\" the statement said.\nLee's ruling Democratic Party, which controls parliament, is planning to pass a bill this week which suspends ongoing trials for the incumbent president, local broadcaster KBS reported on Monday.\nThe Constitutional Court may be asked to rule whether the bill is unconstitutional, legal experts have said.",

    "content": "How Donald Trump's \"America First\" policy, which targets global supply chains, could also signal the end of an era of arbitrage. Beyond trade in goods, this policy may impact tax, regulatory, and financial arbitrage, with potentially more significant consequences for investors.\n•\nTax Arbitrage: U.S. companies have shifted assets offshore to lower-tax jurisdictions, reporting significant profits there compared to the U.S.. This has benefited companies and low-tax countries but not U.S. taxpayers.\n•\nRegulatory Arbitrage: Companies, particularly in finance like insurers, have moved activities to places with looser regulations, such as transferring life insurance reserves to Bermuda. This allows them to free up capital and has aided the growth of private credit firms using offshore insurance operations for funding.\n•\nFinancial Arbitrage: The post-2008 global financial system relies on foreign exchange swaps using U.S. Treasuries held overseas to create international credit. While some see this as an \"exorbitant privilege\" for the U.S., the Trump administration views it as providing a \"global public good\" for free and suggests other countries should \"pay their fair share\".\n\nA potential crackdown on these arbitrages could mean investors should be cautious about industries and firms that benefit significantly from these practices, such as certain pharmaceutical companies or private credit providers reliant on offshore funding. Targeting the dollar-based financial system itself, possibly by taxing foreign investors in U.S. assets, could be even more disruptive to global finance as we know it.",
