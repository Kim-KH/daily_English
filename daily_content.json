    "content": "Today's content focuses on how Donald Trump's \"America First\" policy, which targets global supply chains, could also signal the end of an era of arbitrage. Beyond trade in goods, this policy may impact tax, regulatory, and financial arbitrage, with potentially more significant consequences for investors.\n•\nTax Arbitrage: U.S. companies have shifted assets offshore to lower-tax jurisdictions, reporting significant profits there compared to the U.S.. This has benefited companies and low-tax countries but not U.S. taxpayers.\n•\nRegulatory Arbitrage: Companies, particularly in finance like insurers, have moved activities to places with looser regulations, such as transferring life insurance reserves to Bermuda. This allows them to free up capital and has aided the growth of private credit firms using offshore insurance operations for funding.\n•\nFinancial Arbitrage: The post-2008 global financial system relies on foreign exchange swaps using U.S. Treasuries held overseas to create international credit. While some see this as an \"exorbitant privilege\" for the U.S., the Trump administration views it as providing a \"global public good\" for free and suggests other countries should \"pay their fair share\".\n\nA potential crackdown on these arbitrages could mean investors should be cautious about industries and firms that benefit significantly from these practices, such as certain pharmaceutical companies or private credit providers reliant on offshore funding. Targeting the dollar-based financial system itself, possibly by taxing foreign investors in U.S. assets, could be even more disruptive to global finance as we know it.",

    "content": "How Donald Trump's \"America First\" policy, which targets global supply chains, could also signal the end of an era of arbitrage. Beyond trade in goods, this policy may impact tax, regulatory, and financial arbitrage, with potentially more significant consequences for investors.\n•\nTax Arbitrage: U.S. companies have shifted assets offshore to lower-tax jurisdictions, reporting significant profits there compared to the U.S.. This has benefited companies and low-tax countries but not U.S. taxpayers.\n•\nRegulatory Arbitrage: Companies, particularly in finance like insurers, have moved activities to places with looser regulations, such as transferring life insurance reserves to Bermuda. This allows them to free up capital and has aided the growth of private credit firms using offshore insurance operations for funding.\n•\nFinancial Arbitrage: The post-2008 global financial system relies on foreign exchange swaps using U.S. Treasuries held overseas to create international credit. While some see this as an \"exorbitant privilege\" for the U.S., the Trump administration views it as providing a \"global public good\" for free and suggests other countries should \"pay their fair share\".\n\nA potential crackdown on these arbitrages could mean investors should be cautious about industries and firms that benefit significantly from these practices, such as certain pharmaceutical companies or private credit providers reliant on offshore funding. Targeting the dollar-based financial system itself, possibly by taxing foreign investors in U.S. assets, could be even more disruptive to global finance as we know it.",
